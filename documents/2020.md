## Python library/SDK revamped & updated

[Meraki Dashboard API Python Library](https://github.com/meraki/dashboard-api-python/)

This library's goal is to refresh and supplant the legacy module (this repository versions 0.34 and prior) as well as the now-deprecated [SDK](https://github.com/meraki/meraki-python-sdk). Here are some of the features in this revamped library:
* Support for all API endpoints, as it uses the [OpenAPI specification](https://api.meraki.com/api/v0/openapiSpec) to generate source code
* Log all API requests made to a local file as well as on-screen console
* Automatic retries upon 429 rate limit errors, using the [`Retry-After` field](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api/#/rest/guides/rate-limit-errors) within response headers
* Get all (or a specified number of) pages of data with built-in pagination control
* Tweak settings such as the default base URL (for example, to use with V1 and/or mega-proxy)
* Simulate POST/PUT/DELETE calls to preview first, so that network configuration does not get changed
* Includes the legacy module's functions for backward compatibility
