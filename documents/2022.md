  <img src="../images/api-docs-organizations-screenshot.png" width="500px">


- The **search** capability has been super charged. You can now search for all key information of an API operation and get a detailed listing of related APIs and docs. The search even supports filtering by prefixing your query with `api:` or `doc:`

  <img src="../images/api-docs-search-screenshot.png" width="700px">

To enable our early adopters to test and provide feedback, a new [Early Access section](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/#!api-reference-early-access-overview/early-api-access) of the API docs will include a listing of all new and updated endpoints.

**Me**

Do you ever wonder who you are when developing an application? Now you can easily get the name, email and other details of the account bound to the API key currently in use.

<img src="../images/meraki-api-me.png" width="400px">

**Early API Access** 

Added `"x-release-stage": "beta"` to all beta operations and properties that are available for Early API Access users. 
This is available in the [v1 beta branch](https://github.com/meraki/openapi/blob/v1-beta/openapi/spec2.json) of the Meraki OpenAPI specification. 

Documentation, SDKs and other tooling can now take advantage of this information to highlight features that are in development.

<img src="../images/oas-release-stage-property.png" width="400px">

**API Response Schemas**

We are excited to begin including API response schemas in the OpenAPI specification and documentation. In addition, over 1/3 of all existing endpoints have recently been updated to include schemas with more to come.  

<img src="../images/meraki-response-schema-screenshot.png" width="500px">

**Webhooks**

With the launch of [webhook integrations](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/merakiwebhooks01), there have been a number of new solutions that have been made possible such as IT notification bots, provisioning workflows and custom security requirements for inbound API calls.

We are also happy to announce two new integrations, that were contributed by our community, for all to use as custom payload templates!
