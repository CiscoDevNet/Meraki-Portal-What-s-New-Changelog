### API Feature Enhancements

**List the status of every Meraki device in the entire Organization**

Our Dashboard API has been updated to allow users to pull Meraki node statuses for the entire Organization in one API call and in one JSON blob. This removes the requirement to make many (sometimes thousands) of API calls to retrieve this information, reducing overhead and restrictions from the API rate limit.

This call returns the following attributes in array format:
