### RADIUS Feature Improvements

**Walled Garden added to API**

The SSID Settings API endpoint now supports setting the Walled Garden and Per Client Bandwidth Limits. See the **[API documentation page](http://postman.meraki.com)** or make an API call to get your SSIDs.

**Meraki Cloud-based RADIUS Proxy launched**

All customers will now be able to proxy RADIUS requests through the Meraki backend to their RADIUS servers. This allows your network to have all of your RADIUS packets coming from one destination (the Meraki Cloud) rather than many different destinations from many Access Points. This also reduces the firewall rules required at each site for large deployments.

To see this feature go to **Wireless > Access Control**, and configure a network with WPA2-Enterprise with my RADIUS server and you should now see the option to use the proxy just below the RADIUS server settings.

**Create combined networks with the Dashboard API**

We added the ability to create combined networks from the create network endpoint in the provisioning API. You can specify a space-separated list of network types to create a combined network. All of the network types that currently be created via the API (wireless, switch, appliance, phone) are accepted.
**[Read the API documentation here](http://postman.meraki.com)**

**Hotspot 2.0 settings API endpoint**

There is a new Dashboard API endpoint for returning and updating the Hotspot 2.0 settings for an SSID. An organization must have the **'has_hotspot_20'** NFO in order to use the endpoint.
