### API Feature Improvements
**New API for L3 Firewall Rules on SSIDs**

The Dashboard API has added a new endpoint for reading and writing the L3 firewall rules for an SSID. This feature is available across all MR access points.  Here is a link to the detailed API documentation for the [L3 Firewall Rules endpoint](http://postman.meraki.com)

**DHCP Exceptions allow Networks to override their Templates**

You can now configure fixed IP assignments and reserved IP ranges on a networks that are bound to a configuration template, on the dashboard at **Security Appliance>DHCP**. This will override the settings configured on the template. These new overrides allow for unique VLANs at each site. These settings are also available in the Dashboard API.

**Systems Manager API**

A new collection of API endpoints for Systems Manager EMM are now released - to all customers. The below screenshot shows the available actions. Due to the large number of SM devices in some networks, the API has a unique ability to filter the devices impacted rather than apply to all devices. Users can filter devices by a set of identifiers (id / serial / wifi mac) or by a list of client tags.

Systems Manager

* Move a set of devices to a new network
* List the devices enrolled in an SM network with various specified fields and filters
* Add, delete, or update the tags of a set of devices
* Modify the fields of a device
* Lock a set of devices
* Wipe a device
* Force check-in a set of devices

**Static Routes now in the Dashboard API**

We now support static route configuration via the Dashboard API. It operates in a very similar manner to the existing VLANs API, and allows for editing name, subnet, gateway IP address, enabled/disabled, fixed IP Assignments, and reserved IP Ranges.

**New Phone endpoints added to Dashboard API**

You can now assign contacts, phone numbers and extensions to MC phones using the Dashboard API.

Phone assignments

* List all phones in a network and their contact assignment.
* Return a phone’s contact assignment.
* Assign a contact and number(s) to a phone.
* Remove a phone assignment (unprovision a phone).

Phone contacts

* List the phone contacts in a network.
* Add a contact.
* Update a phone contact. Google Directory contacts cannot be modified.
* Delete a phone contact. Google Directory contacts cannot be removed.

Phone numbers

* List the available phone numbers in a network
* List all the phone numbers in a network

### API Feature Improvements

**Combined Templates added to API Dashboard API now supports GET for device uplink information**

The Meraki dashboard endpoint will now return an array of hashes of information about the device’s uplinks.

Example responses - for a switch:

### API Feature Improvements

**Bluetooth Clients added to the Scanning API**

Meraki access points with an integrated Bluetooth Low Energy radio have the ability to transmit BLE Beacons, as well as to detect and locate BLE devices. BLE scanning allows the Meraki AP to listen for and locate all Bluetooth Low Energy devices. The BLE scanning radio in the access point can detect Beacons, BLE asset tags, and devices like fitness monitors that communicate using BLE data protocols.
When combined with a map of access points in dashboard, the CMX Location API will report Bluetooth client locations as devices on a given floorplan. The location API delivers data in real-time from the Meraki cloud and can be used to detect WiFi devices (associated and non-associated) in real-time. This allows third party applications to provide asset tracking and analytics using battery-based bluetooth tags or wearables like fitness monitors. In addition to the API, Bluetooth-enabled devices like smartphones hear a BLE Beacon emitted by the Meraki access point, and an app on the smartphone can detect it’s distance from the access points using Beacon ranging.</p>

### API Feature Improvements
**Dashboard API Launched to all customers**

Previously access to the API was enabled by contacting support. Now this option can be found on the **Organization > Settings** page to allow any customer to enable the API on their own.
The API docs will be available to all users regardless of whether or not access has been enabled for them at https://api.meraki.com/api_docs. If the API has not been enabled, a banner will appear on the API docs page to let the user know.
